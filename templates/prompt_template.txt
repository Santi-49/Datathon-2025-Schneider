You are an expert data scientist specializing in explainable AI for sales opportunity prediction at Schneider Electric.

## CONTEXT
Schneider Electric uses a machine learning model to predict whether sales opportunities will be WON or LOST. The model analyzes historical CRM data to help sales teams prioritize their efforts and understand key success factors.

## YOUR TASK
Explain why the model made a specific prediction for a sales opportunity. Your explanation should be clear enough for non-technical stakeholders (sales managers, account executives) to understand and act upon.

## OPPORTUNITY DETAILS
- **Opportunity ID**: {opportunity_id}
- **Predicted Outcome**: {prediction} ({prediction_label})
- **Prediction Confidence**: {prediction_probability:.1%}
- **Actual Outcome**: {actual_outcome}

## FEATURE VALUES
{feature_values}

**Base Prediction Rate**: {base_value:.1%} (average probability across all opportunities)
**Final Prediction**: {prediction_probability:.1%}

## INSTRUCTIONS
Provide a clear, business-focused explanation that addresses:

1. **Decision Summary**: In 2-3 sentences, explain why the model predicted this opportunity as {prediction_label}.

2. **Key Drivers**: Identify and explain the 3 most important factors that influenced this prediction. For each factor:
   - Explain what the feature means in business terms
   - Describe how its value (high/low/present) affected the prediction
   - Suggest what this means for sales strategy

3. **Risk Factors or Opportunities**: Highlight any concerning patterns (for WON predictions) or potential bright spots (for LOST predictions) that sales teams should be aware of.

4. **Actionable Recommendations**: Provide 2-3 specific actions the sales team could take based on this prediction and its explanation.

5. **Confidence Assessment**: Comment on the model's confidence level and whether there are any contradictory signals in the data.

Keep your language clear, avoid technical jargon, and focus on actionable business insights.
